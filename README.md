🚀 Network Security Mastermind: Breaking the $\mathbf{80\%}$ Ceiling with Deep LearningThis repository contains the final, high-performance solution for classifying network intrusion attacks ($\text{DoS}$, $\text{Probe}$, $\text{R2L}$, $\text{U2R}$) using the challenging $\text{NSL-KDD}$ dataset.The project successfully proved that Deep Learning was the only method capable of overcoming the severe data scarcity that crippled traditional algorithms.
